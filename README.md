## Introduction
This project is the culmination of our research in the CS 415 course, Data 
Communications and Computer Networks. The project entails creating a wireless sensor 
network (WSN) which is a network of connected sensors that communicate with each 
other to gather and transmit information from one location and transmit them to another. 
They are important as they provide a simple way for a system to collect and store 
information in the cloud by allowing one sensor node to be in a location collecting and 
sending data to another sensor node that can connect to the cloud and store the collected 
data there. Systems can be more complex if more sensor nodes are added to the system 
allowing for data to be captured in many areas at the same time and be stored and 
processed in the cloud.  
The goal for this project is to set up a wireless sensor network with two sensor nodes 
to collect temperature, pressure, and humidity readings from Annaâ€™s backyard and 
compare them to results fetched from an API to view the difference in weather between 
two close microclimates. We also tested the range of the LoRa chips in both obstructed 
and unobstructed environments to find out how far they can transmit in different 
environments.
